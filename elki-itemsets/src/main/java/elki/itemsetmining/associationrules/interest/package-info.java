/**
 * Association rule interestingness measures.
 * <p>
 * Much of the confusion with these measures arises from the anti-monotonicity
 * of itemsets, which are omnipresent in the literature.
 * <p>
 * In the itemset notation, the itemset \(X\) denotes the set of matching
 * transactions \(\{T|X\subseteq T\}\) that contain the itemset \(X\).
 * If we enlarge \(Z=X\cup Y\), the resulting set shrinks:
 * \(\{T|Z\subseteq T\}=\{T|X\subseteq T\}\cap\{T|Y\subseteq T\}\).
 * <p>
 * Because of this: \(\text{support}(X\cup Y) = P(X \cap Y)\)
 * and \(\text{support}(X\cap Y) = P(X \cup Y)\). With "support" and
 * "confidence", it is common to see the reversed semantics (the union on the
 * constraints is the intersection on the matches, and conversely); with
 * probabilities it is common to use "events" as in frequentist inference.
 * <p>
 * To make things worse, the "support" is sometimes in absolute (integer)
 * counts, and sometimes used in a relative share.

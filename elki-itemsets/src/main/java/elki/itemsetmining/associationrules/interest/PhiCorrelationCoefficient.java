/**
 * Phi Correlation Coefficient interestingness measure.
 * <p>
 * \[ \frac{n P(X \cap Y) - P(X) - P(Y)}{\sqrt{P(X)P(Y)P(\neg X)P(\neg Y)}} \]
 * <p>
 * This is closely related to the χ² statistic.

 * The use for association rule mining was studied in:

 * P.-N. Tan, V. Kumar, J. Srivastava<br>
 * Selecting the right objective measure for association analysis<br>
 * Information Systems 29.4

 * Tan et al. attribute this measure to:

 * A. Agresti<br>
 * Categorical Data Analysis<br>

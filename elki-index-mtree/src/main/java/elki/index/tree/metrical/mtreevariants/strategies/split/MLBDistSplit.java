/**
 * Encapsulates the required methods for a split of a node in an M-Tree.
 * The routing objects are chosen according to the MLBDIST strategy.
 * <p>
 * The benefit of this strategy is that it works with precomputed distances from
 * the parent, while most other strategies would require O(nÂ²) distance
 * computations. So if construction time is critical, this is a good choice.

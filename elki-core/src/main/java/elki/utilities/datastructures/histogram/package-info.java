/**
 * Classes for computing histograms
 * <p>
 * This package contains two families of histograms. Static histograms have a
 * fixed initial number of bins. When encountering values outside of their
 * range, they will grow similar to an ArrayList by adding additional bins.
 * <p>
 * "Dynamic" histograms are more useful when you do not know the value range of
 * the data: they start by collecting a number of sample data, then use this to
 * estimate the initial histogram range. If they grow to twice their initial
 * size they will downsample, to keep the histogram size in the bounds n to
 * 2n-1, which effectively limits the memory use and histogram complexity.

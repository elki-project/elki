/**
 * Iterator for DBIDs.
 * <p>
 * Important note: this iterator has a <em>significantly</em> different syntax
 * and semantics than the Java iterators. It is much more aligned with C than
 * with Java, but at the same time, the syntax is much more compatible with for
 * loops.
 * <p>
 * Usage example:
 *
 * <pre>
 * {@code 
 * for (DBIDIter iter = ids.iter(); iter.valid(); iter.advance()) {
 *   Object o = relation.get(iter); // Many interfaces allow direct use
 *   DBID id = DBIDUtil.deref(iter); // Materialize only if you need to!
 * }
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * We list some fundamental differences.
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link DBIDIter#valid() iter.valid()} refers to the current element,
 * {@code Iterator.next()} to the next.</li>
 * <li>{@link DBIDIter#advance() iter.advance()} does not return an element. Use
 * {@code get...} to access it.</li>
 * <li>{@code DBIDIter.get...} do not advance the iterator.</li>
 * </ul>

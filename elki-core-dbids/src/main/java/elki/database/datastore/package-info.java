/**
 * General data store layer <em>API</em> (along the lines of
 * {@code Map<DBID, T>} - use everywhere!) for ELKI.
 * <p>
 * <h2>When to use:</h2>
 * <p>
 * Every time you need to associate a larger number of objects (in form of
 * {@link elki.database.ids.DBID DBID}s) with any kind of value.
 * This can be temporary values such as KNN lists, but also result values such
 * as outlier scores.
 * <p>
 * Basically, {@code DataStore<T> == Map<DBID, T>}. But this API will allow
 * extensions that can do on-disk maps.
 * <p>
 * <h2>How to use:</h2>
 * {@code
 * // Storage for the outlier score of each ID. 
 * final WritableDoubleDataStore scores = DataStoreFactory.FACTORY.makeDoubleStorage(ids, DataStoreFactory.HINT_STATIC);
 * }
 * 
 * @opt hide datastore.memory
 * @opt hide index.preprocessed

/**
 * Clustering algorithms
 * <p>
 * Clustering algorithms are supposed to implement the
 * {@link elki.Algorithm}-Interface.
 * The more specialized interface
 * {@link elki.clustering.ClusteringAlgorithm}
 * requires an implementing algorithm to provide a special result class suitable
 * as a partitioning of the database. More relaxed clustering algorithms are
 * allowed to provide a result that is a fuzzy clustering, does not partition
 * the database complete or is in any other sense a relaxed clustering result.
 *
 * @opt include .*elki.data.Clustering

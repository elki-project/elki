/**
 * DBSCAN and its generalizations.
 * <p>
 * Generalized DBSCAN is an abstraction of the original DBSCAN idea,
 * that allows the use of arbitrary "neighborhood" and "core point" predicates.
 * <p>
 * For each object, the neighborhood as defined by the "neighborhood" predicate
 * is retrieved - in original DBSCAN, this is the objects within an epsilon
 * sphere around the query object. Then the core point predicate is evaluated to
 * decide if the object is considered dense. If so, a cluster is started (or
 * extended) to include the neighbors as well.
 * <p>

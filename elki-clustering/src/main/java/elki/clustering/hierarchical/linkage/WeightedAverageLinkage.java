/**
 * Weighted average linkage clustering method (WPGMA).
 * <p>
 * This is somewhat a misnomer, as it actually ignores that the clusters should
 * likely be weighted differently according to their size when computing the
 * average linkage. See {@link GroupAverageLinkage} for the UPGMA method
 * that uses the group size to weight the objects the same way.
 * Because of this, it is sometimes also called "simple average".
 * <p>
 * There does not appear to be a closed form distance for this clustering,
 * but it is only defined recursively on the previous clusters simply by
 * \[d_{\text{WPGMA}}(A\cup B,C):=\tfrac{1}{2}d(A,C)+\tfrac{1}{2}d(B,C)\]
 * <p>
 * {@link MedianLinkage} (WPGMC) is similar in the sense that it is ignoring
 * the cluster sizes, and therefore the weight of points decreases with the
 * depth of the tree. The method is "weighted" in the sense that the new members
 * get the weight adjusted to match the old cluster members.

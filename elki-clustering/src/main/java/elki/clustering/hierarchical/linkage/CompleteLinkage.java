/**
 * Complete-linkage ("maximum linkage") clustering method.
 * <p>
 * The distance of two clusters is simply the maximum of all pairwise distances
 * between the two clusters.
 * <p>
 * The distance of two clusters is defined as:
 * \[d_{\max}(A,B):=\max_{a\in A}\max_{b\in B} d(a,b)\]
 * <p>
 * This can be computed recursively using:
 * \[d_{\max}(A\cup B,C) = \max(d(A,C), d(B,C))\]
 * <p>
 * Note that with similarity functions, one would need to use the minimum
 * instead to get the same effect.
 * <p>
 * The algorithm {@link CLINK} is a faster algorithm to find such clusterings,
 * but it is very much order dependent and tends to find worse solutions.
 * <p>
 * References:
 * <p>
 * This is attributed to different sources that are not easily verifiable. Lance
 * and Williams (1967) attribute the idea to Macnaughton-Smith, albeit he may
 * have suggested a divisive rather than agglomerative procedure, but Sørensen
 * may have used this already in 1948 (and is credited, e.g., by Johnson 1967).

/**
 * Centroid linkage &mdash; Unweighted Pair-Group Method using Centroids
 * (UPGMC).
 * <p>
 * This is closely related to {@link GroupAverageLinkage} (UPGMA), but the
 * resulting distance corresponds to the distance of the cluster centroids when
 * used with squared Euclidean distance.
 * <p>
 * For Lance-Williams, we can then obtain the following recursive definition:
 * \[d_{\text{UPGMC}}(A\cup B,C)=\tfrac{|A|}{|A|+|B|} d(A,C) +
 * \tfrac{|B|}{|A|+|B|} d(B,C) - \tfrac{|A|\cdot|B|}{(|A|+|B|)^2} d(A,B)\]
 * <p>
 * With <em>squared</em> Euclidean distance, we then get the cluster distance:
 * \[d_{\text{UPGMC}}(A,B)=||\tfrac{1}{|A|}\sum\nolimits_{a\in A} a,
 * \tfrac{1}{|B|}\sum\nolimits_{b\in B} b||^2\]
 * but for other distances, this will not generally be true.
 * <p>
 * Because the ELKI implementations use Lance-Williams, this linkage should only
 * be used with (squared) Euclidean distance.
 * <p>
 * While titled "unweighted", this method does take cluster sizes into account
 * when merging clusters with Lance-Williams.
 * <p>
 * While the idea of this method &mdash; at least for squared Euclidean &mdash;
 * is compelling (distance of cluster centers), it is not as well behaved as one
 * may think. It can yield so called "inversions", where a later merge has a
 * smaller distance than an early merge, because a cluster center <em>can</em>
 * be closer to a neighboring cluster than any of the individual points. Because
 * of this, the {@link GroupAverageLinkage} (UPGMA) is usually preferable.

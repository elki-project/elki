/**
 * Group-average linkage clustering method (UPGMA).
 * <p>
 * This is a good default linkage to use with hierarchical clustering, as it
 * neither exhibits the single-link chaining effect, nor has the strong tendency
 * of complete linkage to split large clusters. It is also easy to understand,
 * and it can be used with arbitrary distances and similarity functions.
 * <p>
 * The distances of two clusters is defined as the between-group average
 * distance of two points $a$ and $b$, one from each cluster. It should be noted
 * that this is not the average distance within the resulting cluster, because
 * it does not take within-cluster distances into account.
 * <p>
 * The distance of two clusters in this method is:
 * \[d_{\text{UPGMA}}(A,B)=\tfrac{1}{|A|\cdot|B|}
 * \sum\nolimits_{a\in A}\sum\nolimits_{b\in B} d(a,b)\]
 * <p>
 * For Lance-Williams, we can then obtain the following recursive definition:
 * \[d_{\text{UPGMA}}(A\cup B,C)=\tfrac{|A|}{|A|+|B|} d(A,C) +
 * \tfrac{|B|}{|A|+|B|} d(B,C)\]
 * <p>
 * While the method is also called "Unweighted Pair Group Method with Arithmetic
 * mean", it uses weights in the Lance-Williams formulation that account for the
 * cluster size. It is unweighted in the sense that every point keeps the same
 * weight, whereas in {@link WeightedAverageLinkage} (WPGMA), the weight of
 * points effectively depends on the depth in the cluster tree.

/**
 * A polynomial fit is a specific type of multiple regression. The simple
 * regression model (a first-order polynomial) can be trivially extended to
 * higher orders.
 * <p>
 * The regression model y = b0 + b1*x + b2*x^2 + ... + bp*x^p + e is a system of
 * polynomial equations of order p with polynomial coefficients { b0 ... bp}.
 * The model can be expressed using data matrix x, target double[] y and parameter
 * double[] ?. The ith row of X and Y will contain the x and y value for the ith
 * data sample.
 * <p>
 * The variables will be transformed in the following way: x =&gt; x1, ..., x^p
 * =&gt; xp Then the model can be written as a multiple linear equation model:
 * y = b0 + b1*x1 + b2*x2 + ... + bp*xp + e

/**
 * Perform Anderson-Darling test for a Gaussian distribution.
 * <p>
 * This is a test <em>against</em> normality / goodness of fit. I.e. you can use
 * it to <em>reject</em> the hypothesis that the data is normal distributed.
 * Such tests are sensitive to data set size: on small samples, even large
 * deviations could be by-chance and thus not allow rejection. On the other
 * hand, on large data sets even a slight deviation can be unlikely to happen if
 * the data were indeed normal distributed. Thus, this test is more likely to
 * fail to reject small data sets even when they intuitively do not appear to be
 * normal distributed, while it will reject large data sets that originate from
 * a distribution only slightly different from the normal distribution.
 * <p>
 * Before using, make sure you have understood statistical tests, and the
 * difference between failure-to-reject and acceptance!
 * <p>
 * The data size should be at least 8 before the results start getting somewhat
 * reliable. For large data sets, the chance of rejecting the normal
 * distribution hypothesis increases a lot: no real data looks exactly like a
 * normal distribution.

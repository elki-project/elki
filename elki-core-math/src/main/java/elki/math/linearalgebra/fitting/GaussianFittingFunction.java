/**
 * Gaussian function for parameter fitting
 * <p>
 * Based loosely on fgauss in the book "Numerical Recipies".<br>
 * We did not bother to implement all optimizations at the benefit of having
 * easier to use parameters. Instead of position, amplitude and width used in
 * the book, we use the traditional Gaussian parameters mean, standard deviation
 * and a linear scaling factor (which is mostly useful when combining multiple
 * distributions) The cost are some additional computations such as a square
 * root and probably a slight loss in precision. This could of course have been
 * handled by an appropriate wrapper instead.
 * <p>
 * Due to their license, we cannot use their code, but we have to implement the
 * mathematics ourselves. We hope the loss in precision isn't big.
 * <p>
 * They are also arranged differently: the book uses
 * <code>amplitude, position, width</code> whereas we use
 * <code>mean, stddev, scaling</code>.<br>
 * But we're obviously using essentially the same mathematics.
 * <p>
 * The function also can use a mixture of gaussians, just use an appropriate
 * number of parameters (which obviously needs to be a multiple of 3)

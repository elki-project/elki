/**
 * Class to unit test the k-d-tree like spatial sorter.
 * 
 * Understanding this on discrete data is tricky, because of ties. It is
 * intended for continuous data.
 * 
 * In each recursion, the median object is selected as pivot. This point is now
 * fixed, and both halves are processed recursively, with the next dimension.
 * So first, the median on X is found, in the basic test below this is the
 * record with x=2. For the upper half, the next pivot is the median in y, i.e.
 * y=1, for the lower half y=2. <b>Ties are broken pseudo-randomly, because the
 * QuickSelec is based on swapping points to find the median, and may not
 * preserve order</b>. It would be easier to understand on toy data if we would
 * use a stable sort, but also more expensive.

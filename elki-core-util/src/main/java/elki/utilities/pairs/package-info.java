/**
 * Pairs utility classes
 * <p>
 * A number of commonly needed primitive pairs are the following:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link elki.utilities.pairs.IntIntPair IntIntPair} storing
 * two <code>int</code> values</li>
 * <li>{@link elki.utilities.pairs.DoubleIntPair DoubleIntPair}
 * storing one <code>double</code> and one <code>int</code> value.</li>
 * <li>{@link elki.utilities.pairs.IntDoublePair IntDoublePair}
 * storing one <code>int</code> and one <code>double</code> value.</li>
 * <li>{@link elki.utilities.pairs.DoubleDoublePair
 * DoubleDoublePair} storing two <code>double</code> values</li>
 * </ul>
 * Why no more {@code Pair<A,B>}?
 * <ul>
 * <li>Because such pairs are expensive in Java when using primitive types.</li>
 * <li>Because domain-specific code can often be optimized better by the HotSpot
 * VM.</li>
 * </ul>
 * 
 * @opt hide java.lang.

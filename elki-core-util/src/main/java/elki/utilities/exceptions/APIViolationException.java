/**
 * This class indicates an exception likely caused by an API not implemented
 * correctly. ELKI has some API interface restrictions that cannot be expressed
 * in the Java language and that are checked at runtime. This in particular
 * includes parameterization and dynamic binding of algorithms to data.
 * 
 * This exception indicates that such an API might not have been implemented
 * correctly; you should check the documentation of interfaces you implement for
 * API descriptions that are not expressible in Java (and thus not checked by
 * the Java compiler).

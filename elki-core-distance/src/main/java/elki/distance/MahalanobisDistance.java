/**
 * Mahalanobis quadratic form distance for feature vectors.
 * <p>
 * For a weight matrix M, this distance is defined as
 * \[ \text{Mahalanobis}_M(\vec{x},\vec{y}) :=
 * \sqrt{(\vec{x}-\vec{y})^T \cdot M \cdot (\vec{x}-\vec{y})} \]
 * <p>
 * Reference:

 * P. C. Mahalanobis<br>
 * On the generalized distance in statistics<br>
 * Proceedings of the National Institute of Sciences of India. 2 (1)
 * <p>
 * This is the implementation as quadratic form distance function. In many cases
 * it will be more convenient to use the static function
 * {@link elki.math.linearalgebra.VMath#mahalanobisDistance}
 * instead.
 * <p>
 * TODO: Add a factory with parameterizable weight matrix! Right now, this can
 * only be used from Java and from subclasses, not from command line or MiniGUI.
